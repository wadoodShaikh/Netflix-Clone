## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a landing page from scratch
- Using `max-height` and `overflow: hidden` for CSS-only dropdowns
- Flexbox and media queries for layout control
- Building real-world styled components (hero, cards, footer)
- Separating base and responsive styles for clean maintainability
